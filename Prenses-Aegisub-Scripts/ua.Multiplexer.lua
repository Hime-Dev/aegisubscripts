	Muxing script version 1.1
	Read everything here before using it.
	
	
	DISCLAIMER
	
	You are receiving this badly written piece of code for several reasons:
	
	1. I can't write good code
	2. I don't have time to learn to write good code
	3. I don't particularly care about good code, as long as my bad code works
	4. The people who can write good code spend more time criticizing my code than writing their own
	5. I have somehow accidentally become the main lua-code-writer in fansubbing (hell knows why), so you don't have much choice
	
	Conclusion: deal with it.
	
	
	
	TERMS AND CONDITIONS
	
	
	1. You may NOT use this software if
	
	  - You are autistic about badly written code.
	    This includes complaining about things written in a way you don't like, even though they work,
	    spending hours criticizing bad code instead of writing a better one,
	    complaining about code you're not even using, and so on.
	    
	  - You are a citizen of the United States of America or Israel.
	    We do not support ZioNazi countries that routinely break International Law, murder innocent civilians by thousands,
	    use their police/military to beat up elderly people, taser children to death, or shoot whole families while raiding the wrong house,
	    invade other countries on false premises, organize or support coup d'etats in other countries, support dictators worldwide,
	    create terrorist organizations and then tell us we have to fight them, engage routinely in false-flag terrorism,
	    feed us daily with lies about Saddam's nonexistent WMDs, Hamas's rockets that are either nonexistent or fired by MOSSAD agents,
	    and other similar things, and generally strive every day to fuck up the whole planet.
	    
	  - You work for Monsanto or another rabidly insane corporation hell-bent on destroying the Earth.
	  
	  - You are under 30 years of age. Kids shouldn't play with badly written code.
	  
	  
	2. You are NOT allowed to
	
	  - Steal any part of this code, because it's bad for you to use bad code.
	  
	  - Modify this code in any way, because modifying bad code is like playing with grenades.
	  
	  - Sell this code, because selling bad code equals terrorism!
	  
	  
	3. You ARE allowed to
	
	  - Use this code to do what it's designed to do (see USAGE section), as long as conditions 1 and 2 are met.
	  
	  - Report real bugs, as in when the software isn't correctly doing what it claims to be able to do.
	  
	  - Ask for new features, as long as such features make sense within the scope of what this software does.
	  
	  - Read the comments in this file and learn something about writing lua scripts for Aegisub.
	  
	  - Use the software beyond its limitations (see point 4) ONLY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
	    I will not be responsible for any damage you cause that way.
	  
	  - Write better code.
	  
	  - Do all kinds of things that have no relation to this software whatsoever, like bungee jumping.
	  
	  
	4. Limitations:
	
	  This software has a (probably large) number of limitations, both documented and undocumented.
	  Documented ones are as follows:
	  
	  - This software is designed to work on Windows, even though Windows is shit, because that's the only OS I have and can work with.
	    As such, what the software will do on other OSs is completely unpredictable to me, thus it may or may not work as intended,
	    and may possibly harm your computer or do even worse things, like stab you in the eye or end the world.
	    
	  - Unicode characters in file/folder names.
	    Running lua from within Aegisub has various limitations compared to running it just under Windows,
	    especially with regards to messing with files and folders. I don't possess extensive knowledge on these matters,
	    but my personal experience shows that unicode characters in file/folder names is a likely factor to make things not work,
	    without it being very clear why exactly it is that they are not working.
	    Therefore it is recommended that folder names and file names do not contain any such characters.
	    
	  - External programs (without which this software's functionality is limited or impossible)
	    
	    I. Mkvmerge.
	       Mkvmerge is absolutely necessary for this software to do anything of use, i.e. muxing, its primary purpose.
	       Mkvmerge must be installed on your computer and a path to it given in the top field of this software's GUI.
	       Note that the file required is mkvmerge.exe and not mmg.exe.
	       
	    II. Enfis_SFV.exe
	        This is required if you want your muxed mkv file to automatically contain its CRC in the filename.
		If you don't need this feature, Enfis is not necessary.
		
	    III. xdelta
	         If you wish to create an xdelta file that patches your source video to the muxed video,
		 you need to download xdelta3.exe and input its location in the GUI.
		 Whether you call it xdelta3.exe or xdelta.exe or whatever else is unimportant,
		 as long as it's the correct file and the file path/name is correct.
		 
	    IV. Lua for Windows
	        This is not required if you don't need CRC/xdelta but is necessary if you want to use those.
		The reason is that the code that creates the CRC/xdelta can only be run after a video file is muxed
		and thus is run outside of Aegisub.
		As the only language I can write this in is lua, it requires Lua for Windows to run.
		You can download this for free from the Internet.
		Note: It would be possible to do everything from Aegisub if run right away,
		      but I wanted the whole process to be executable from a single batch file that you can run later.
	  
	  - You can not change the contents of the source video, i.e. whatever streams it already has will be used.
	  
	  - You can mux only two subtitle files.
	  
	  - You can only set track name and language for subtitle files.
	  
	  - You have to set the language code manually, thus you have to know what the correct code is.
	    You can't just type 'english' and think it will work. You can check these codes in mkvmerge.
	    The correct for English is 'eng (English)'. You can use either of those two - 'eng' or 'English'.
	    But there is a difference between 'English' and 'english', the latter being invalid.
	  
	  - Detecting muxed video name and episode number
	    This process is currently very limited and not very likely to be significantly improved,
	    unless unexpectedly good suggestions arise.
	    This name and number are used for two things:
	    - to try to determine the muxed encode's name
	    - to locate fonts folder if set to "script folder/ep number" or "video folder/ep number"
	    There are two places to look for these variables:
	    - (primary) Script title (in Properties in Aegisub)
	    - (secondary) script filename (.ass file)
	    If at least one of these contains the show's name and episode number, things should work well,
	    assuming the number is the last thing in the name.
	    If no number is found, the whole string is the name, and episode number is an empty string.
	    (Thus "script folder/ep number" should become the same as "script folder".)
	    If for whatever reason this process doesn't produce the desired results,
	    you have to type Muxed video name manually.
	    This is important when creating an xdelta file, as it will contain the given filename,
	    and if you rename the muxed file later, the patch will not work!
	    
	  Other limitations are possible, even likely.
	  If you find such limitations and think they could reasonably be removed, report them.
	
	
	
	USAGE
	
	
	1. To ensure correct usage, read TERMS AND CONDITIONS first.
	
	
	2. What this script can do.
	
	   This script should be able, fairly easily, to mux a video and subtitle file you have loaded in your Aegisub.
	   It can mux a secondary subtitle file that you select.
	   It can also mux a selected xml file with chapters.
	   When all appropriate conditions are met, it can add correct CRC to the muxed file's name.
	   When even more conditions are met, it can create an xdelta file to patch the source video to the muxed one.
	   It can also, for various reasons, fail to do the things just described.
	   It can possibly drive you mad by repeated failures for reasons you're desperately trying to ascertain
	   but which inexplicably keep eluding you.
	   It can occasionally fail to even load because you're using a shitty browser called Chrome,
	   which likes to add, for reasons unclear, html tags to downloaded lua files.
	   It can lock your Aegisub for a while if you're muxing a huge video file.
	   It can most likely do other unspecified things that no one has discovered yet. Those are, however, not intentional.
	
	
	3. Explanation of the GUI.
	
	  - mkvmerge.exe
	    This is an essential part of this software. You can't mux without this file.
	    Use the mkvmerge button at the bottom and navigate to where your mkvmerge.exe is.
	    To make the GUI remember the path, use the 'Save settings' button.
	  
	  - Fonts folder
	    This is where the script will look for fonts that are to be muxed.
	    The presets are for the script folder and video folder (which may be the same).
	    The option with '/fonts' means the fonts should be in a folder called 'fonts' in the script/video folder.
	    The option with '/ep number' means that instead of 'fonts', the folder will be called for example '01'.
	    This number is determined as described in TERMS AND CONDITIONS under '4. Limitations',
	    section 'Detecting muxed video name and episode number'.
	    If you use 'custom path:', use the 'fonts' button at the bottom, navigate to the folder where your fonts are,
	    and select one of the fonts. (Aegisub doesn't allow selecting just folders. The filename will be removed.)
	    
	  - Group tag
	    Here you can set your group's tag, which will be automatically used at the beginning of the muxed video's name.
	    Example: [TerribleSubs]
	    
	  - Enfis_SFV.exe
	    This is needed only when creating CRC (which is needed when making an xdelta file.)
	    It's an external binary which you can download for example here: http://unanimated.xtreemhost.com/SFV_Checker.zip
	    
	  - xdelta(3).exe
	    This is needed only when creating an xdelta patch. Easily downloadable from the Internet.
	    It doesn't matter whether the name is xdelta.exe or xdelta3.exe as long as the path leads to the correct file.
	    
	  - Muxed video name:
	    The script tries to build this name from information it collects.
	    Again, see section 'Detecting muxed video name and episode number' for more details.
	    the basic pattern is: 'GroupTag Name - EpNumber.mkv'
	    Depending on how you name your script's Title and filename, this may be more or less useful.
	    Adjust the filename manually as needed.
	    When using CRC, the CRC is inserted after the episode number automatically after muxing, with the usual pattern.
	    
	  - Source video
	    This is the video to be used for muxing and should be the video you have loaded in Aegisub.
	    Obviously, trying to mux without video loaded will result in failure.
	    
	  - -A/-S/-M/nc/nt
	    Options for source video. (Disable audio, subs, attachments, chapters, tags.)
	  
	  - File/segment title
	    Same as in mkvmerge, this is what's displayed in medianfo and players as the 'Movie name'.
	  
	  - Video options
	    Additional options for source video. May include --track-name etc.
	  
	  - Subtitle 1
	    This is the subtitle file to be used for muxing and should be the subtitle file you have loaded in Aegisub.
	    Obviously, trying to mux without the correct subtitle file loaded will result in failure.
	    
	  - Set as default
	    This is useful when the input video already has subtitles and you want your subs to be the default ones.
	    
	  - Subtitle 1 mkv title
	    This is the title of the subtitles that you can see in your player when selecting a subtitle stream.
	    This field is optional.
	    
	  - Language
	    This is the language displayed in your player for this subtitle stream.
	    This field is optional.
	    
	  - Subtitle 2
	    You can use one instance of alternative subtitles, for example with/without honorifics, or another language.
	    Use the 'Subs 2' button to locate the file (or paste a correct path).
	    
	  - Subtitle 2 mkv title + language
	    Same as for the first one; optional.
	    
	  - Chapters
	    If you need to mux chapters, use the Chapters button to locate the xml file.
	    If it exists in the same folder as your subtitle file and has the same naming pattern, it will be selected automatically.
	    It will, however, only be muxed if the checkbox is checked.
	    
	  - Create CRC
	    Use this if you want the CRC in the filename of the muxed file.
	    This requires Enfis_SFV.exe as explained above, as well as Lua for Windows.
	    
	  - Create xdelta patch
	    Use this if you want an xdelta file that patches the source video (premux, workraw) to the muxed file.
	    This requires Enfis_SFV.exe, xdelta3.exe, and Lua for Windows.
	    You can't make an xdelta without creating CRC.
	    
	  - Delete temporary files when done
	    The whole process creates a bunch of files required for everything to work.
	    These normally serve no purpose when everything works and can and should be deleted afterwards.
	    If, however, the process fails at some point, it's useful to keep the files to determine what exactly failed.
	    
	  - Keep cmd window open
	    This, again, is not necessary, and in fact rather useless when everything works,
	    but can be helpful when the muxing fails, as the cmd window will stay open
	    and you should be able to see which part of the process failed.
	    
	  - Buttons:
	    Mux: Creates files needed for muxing. (Muxing itself has to be confirmed in a later dialog.)
	    mkvmerge: lets you select mkvmerge.exe on your HD.
	    fonts: lets you select a folder containing fonts for muxing (though you need to select one of the files).
	    Enfis: lets you select Enfis_SFV.exe on your HD.
	    xdelta: lets you select xdelta3.exe on your HD.
	    Subs 2: lets you select an alternative subtitle file.
	    Chapters: lets you select chapters file (xml).
	    Save settings: Saves settings - top 5 lines of GUI (except custom path), languages for subs, and bottom 4 checkboxes.
	    Cancel: Casts level 3 Invisibility on your GUI. (Lasts until summoned again.)
	
	
	4. The Muxing Process.
	
	   When you set up everything correctly, click on the Mux button.
	   A cmd window will flash and close.
	   This part of the process creates the necessary files for muxing.
	   Then a dialog will pop up (assuming there was no error) that will list:
	   - Files to mux (video, subtitles)
	   - Number of fonts to mux that the script found
	   - The final filename of the muxed mkv
	   - Location of 'muxing.bat' (should be same as video's location)
	   
	   In case of any problems, or during first tests, it's useful to check these statistics.
	   
	   Make sure the video and subtitle files are correct.
	   The number of fonts should give you an idea if it found all of them. (Only ttf and otf are supported.)
	   Make sure the muxed file's name is correct, especially if doing CRC.
	   When doing CRC, the filename will contain [CRC], because the actual CRC hasn't been created yet; it will be replaced later.
	   
	   'muxing.bat' is what executes the whole muxing process, including CRC and xdelta if selected.
	   
	   If you click Yes, the muxing starts immediately.
	   If you click No, you can run 'muxing.bat' later.
	   
	   Running things from Windows may in some cases have more permissions than running things from Aegisub,
	   so choosing No and running the batch file from Windows may have higher rate of success.
	   (I don't really know the specifics, though, so don't quote me on that.)
	   
	   What happens when you start muxing:
	   
	   - A batch file (mux.bat) in the fonts folder muxes the video + subtitles + fonts.
	     This should have a relatively low chance to fail, compared to the later parts.
	     If you don't do CRC, this is all that needs to be done.
	     
	   - CRC creation / xdelta
	     Enfis_SFV.exe is called to create a sfv file with the CRC.
	     sfv.lua (in video folder) creates 'patchrel.bat' and possibly 'xdbatch.bat' (if making xdelta).
	     Creating xdelta without CRC is not allowed.
	     patchrel adds the correct CRC to the muxed video's name.
	     xdbatch creates the xdelta file.
	     Note: sfv.lua could do the renaming and patching right away, but i hate running os.execute from lua,
	           because it's a pain in the ass and causes more problems than anything else, so i prefer those bat files.
	
	
	5. Predictable Problems and Possible Solutions.
	
	   It's probably quite likely that the first try won't work, as there are plenty of things that can go wrong.
	   Several basic things to do in such a case would be:
	   I. Make sure all the filenames and file paths are correct, that all the needed files actually exist in the right place.
	   II. Check 'Keep cmd window open'. If you get to muxing at least, the cmd window should tell you what part failed.
	   III. uncheck 'Delete temporary files when done'.
	        While the cmd window will tell you what part of the process failed, it may not clearly tell you why.
		Find which of the temp files it failed at, and try to execute that file under Windows.
		You should open a new cmd window first and navigate to the folder, so that the window stays open and shows you the error.
		This is especially the case with sfv.lua. If the problem is with that one,
		running it from a cmd window under Windows will tell you which line it failed at and why.
	   IV. If the process fails with CRC or xdelta, try the same without CRC first to see if that part works.
	       This narrows down where the error occurred.
	   
	   The problems are often with files or folders not found, which may be because they were incorrectly specified,
	   they had unicode characters in them, possibly some characters that have a function in batch files
	   (I only work around '=' in folder names; not sure what others are a problem), or for other reasons(?).
	   It can be useful to test in a simply named folder in the root, like 'D:\sub', to eliminate naming problems.
	   
	   If you start muxing and muxing actually occurs, you see the progress of muxing in the cmd window.
	   This takes a while, depending on the size of the video.
	   If the cmd window disappears within about 5 seconds and the process fails, it's probably the muxing that failed.
	   If you keep the cmd window open and scroll up to the muxing part, you should see the relevant error.
	   
	   Make sure you have Lua for Windows installed (for CRC), and that lua files are associated with it!
	   If this isn't the case, it may be hard to detect what's failing.
	   
	   ttc (and other, even weirder types of) fonts don't get muxed. Don't use them.
	
	
	6. Tips and Recommendations.
	
	   - Don't use unicode characters anywhere in the process.
	   
	   - For smooth automatic naming, use this pattern in the script's Title: 'Show's name 01' or 'Show's name - 01',
	     where 01 is the episode number.
	     The Title is ignored if it's empty or the default, in which case the .ass filename is used.
	     Generally speaking, just use the 'name number' pattern with space, ' - ', or nothing in between.
	     
	   - At least until you get things to work reliably, test with mkvextract or mmg if all fonts are actually in the muxed mkv.
